However, after running this statement, the df still has all of the same rows. How can you fix that?
    Add the inplace=True argument to the dropna() method.

3. You need to plot two columns from the df data frame: 'column1' and 'column2':
df[['column1'],['column2']].plot()
However, the statement above will return a TypeError. What is the correct syntax?
    df[['column1', 'column2']].plot()

4. Which Pandas method gives you an overview about each column's data type, its overall shape, and total memory usage of a DataFrame?
    info()

5. You decide to plot the df Pandas data frame as a histogram:

8. You run the following method on your df data frame:
df.fillna(200)
What is the return value of this method call?
    A new data frame

9. You found duplicated rows inside of the df data frame:
df[df.duplicated()]
The first occurrence of this duplicated row is not considered a duplicate, it is considered as the original row. How can you modify this method call to consider the last duplicated row as an original and not a duplicate?
    df[df.duplicated(keep='last')]

10. You used the following method to fill the empty cells inside of your data frame:
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
However, the empty cell in one of the columns from the first row is still empty. Why?
    Because 'ffill' uses the value from the previous row to fill an empty cell

11. You are using Jupyter Notebook to see the visualization of your df data frame plot. How can you configure the notebook to automatically show the plot visualization after the evaluated cell?
    %matplotlib inline
    df.plot()

12. Your df data frame has some rows with the same value inside of the 'username' column. How can you remove them from the data frame?
    df.drop_duplicates(subset="username", inplace=True)

13. You are using the df data frame's plot() method to create a figure:
df.plot(x='someColumn', y=["Median", "P75th"])
However, once you compile the Python file, nothing is shown on the screen. What do you need to add inside of the script to actually show the plotted figure?

    Invoke the matplotlib pyplot's show() method:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.show()

14. You decide to plot your df data frame on a line chart:
df.plot()
However, the method call above will return some kind of an output string. How can you configure the Jupyter Notebook to create a visualization with matplotlib?
    %matplotlib inline

15. What will happen if you run the following commands in an ipython cell?
import pandas
import pandas as pd
from pandas import *
    You can access Pandas methods directly, using pandas and its alias pd.

16. Consider the following DataFrame with 10 rows and three columns:
df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': ['a', 'b', 'h', 'k', 'k', 'a', 'a', 'p', 'r', 'g'],
                'col2': [4, 7, 7, 8, 3, 1, 2, 7, 8, 1],
                'col3': [9, 6, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 4, 6, 1]}, 
                index=list('abcdefghij'))
You must display the second to last row of the DataFrame and run the command df.tail(2). This command results in the last two consecutive rows instead of the second to last row. What changes would you make to the command to rectify the mistake?
    df.tail(2).iloc[0]

17. What would happen if you pass show_counts=True in the df.info() statement?
    You will observe the non-null counts corresponding to each column.

arr = np.arange(3)
with np.nditer(arr, op_flags=['readonly']) as temp:
    for i in temp:

The only information you have is that the data type is either int, float, complex128, or str. What other attribute can you use to figure out the data type of the array?
    Use arr.itemsize so the result is 16 for a complex128 array data type.

6. You have an existing array: arr = np.array([[5+8j, 9, 3, 2], [9, 0, 8, 3]]).

arr1 = np.array([[5, 9, 3, 210], [9, 0, 8, 3]])
arr2 = np.array([[5], [9], [10], [3]])
arr = arr1 * arr2.T
You perform a multiplication operation on these arrays and save the result into a new array that consumes 32 bytes in total (arr.nbytes). 
The array exceeds the memory limit set in your project. What changes would you make to the code to decrease the memory that the array occupies without affecting the arr result?
    Use the command arr = arr.astype(np.int16).

    [0, 0, 0, 0]

20. You have a NumPy array with three float items ,78.5, 45.8, and 12.2. How would you iterate over this array, multiply each item by 85, and store the result back to the original array?
arr = np.array([78.5, 45.8, 12.2])
    for i in np.nditer(arr, op_flags=['readwrite']):
        i[...] = i * 85

-----------------------------------------------
1. Which command correctly specifies the value "Y" to an environment variable named ACCEPT_EULA? 
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y"

2. A multi-container cluster consists of a web application that relies on a database container. The web application periodically issues error messages to customers because it begins serving requests before the database is available. How can you solve this problem?
Make the web application container depend on the database container.

3. You are developing a containerized application that includes sensitive data in a file called secrets.txt. You want to ensure that this file is not included in the Docker image when it is built. How should you proceed?

docker push user01/my-app:1.1

5. You start working on a new project that uses Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple microservices. After cloning the project repository onto a fresh development machine, you must prepare the environment for the first time. The Docker images specified for the services in the docker-compose.yml file are not present locally. How should you proceed with the docker-compose up command?
Run docker-compose up directly because Docker Compose automatically pulls the missing images from the registry.

6. An application requires a connection string to a database. The application is connecting to the database through a managed identity instead of credentials in the connection string. Where can you store this information? 
In either a configuration file or in an environment variable

7. A Docker image is pushed to a registry as part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. What implications does this have for the distribution of the application across different environments?
It ensures that the same version of the application runs in all environments.

8. Given the following Docker Compose configuration, what happens if a service's container crashes?
deploy:
   restart_policy:
      condition: on-failure
      max_attempts: 3
      window: 120s
The container restarts, making three attempts to recover and waiting 120 seconds between restart attempts.

9. You are creating a Dockerfile for a new application. The application's source code is located in a directory named /app/src within the Dockerfile. How would you ensure that all commands in the Dockerfile run within this directory?
Add WORKDIR /app/src to the Dockerfile.

10. Which command removes all local volumes that containers do not use?
docker volume prune

11. You have multiple services that Docker Compose orchestrates. One of the services is unexpectedly accessible from outside the network. Which is the most likely explanation?
The service has a specific port opened in the Docker Compose configuration that allows outside access.

12. Which command lists the running compose projects?  
docker compose ls  

13. What does the -p option do in the docker run command?
Specifies the port mapping between the host and the container

14. How can you start a Docker container in detached mode?
docker run -d <image_name>

15. You deploy a new application in a Docker container. The container does not start up as you expect. Which Docker command should you use to identify the issue?
docker logs <container-id>

16. An application has a small read-only dataset that changes weekly. This is the only part of the application that changes more often than quarterly. Which strategy should you use to run multiple containers and keep their data consistent and up to date?
Place the volatile data in a shared volume.

17. What is the primary purpose of Docker Compose?
To orchestrate multiple containers

18. An application has many dependencies. You must deploy the app on multiple servers with different operating systems. How could you apply containerization to simplify this process?
Package the application and all its dependencies into a container.

19. What is something you should include in a Docker image?
The operating system libraries that the application requires

20. You want to start a container from an image and remove the container once it exits. What command should you use?
docker run --rm <image>


Continuous Integration with Jenkins: Novice
-----------------------------------------------
1. You are adding a custom image to an Anchore repository from a private registry. You use the following command:
docker-compose exec engine-api anchore-cli image add poc.sample.com/java_maven_sc_centos_centos7.6.1810 --dockerfile=/d01/aevolume/dockerfile_testexec

and receive the following error:

"Invalid value for "--dockerfile": Path "/d01/aevolume/dockerfile_testexec" does not exist.".

What is the most likely explanation for this issue?

Since you are executing anchore-cli from the engine-api container, anchore-cli can't access the path on your host.

2. What does the agent section of a Jenkins pipeline specify?
Where the entire pipeline, or a specific stage, will execute in the Jenkins environment

3. You want to learn more about all the Jenkins plugins you installed and get a list of all your installed plugins. What Groovy script can you use in the Jenkins Script Console to accomplish this?
Jenkins.instance.pluginManager.plugins.each{
  plugin -> 
    println (""${plugin.getDisplayName()} (${plugin.getShortName()}): ${plugin.getVersion()}"")
}

4. When you need to review the complete text log output of a job, where should you look?
The Console Output

5. What allows you to get various configuration options for Jenkins?
Manage Jenkins

6. You are implementing "Pipeline as Code" into your deployment environment and set up your Jenkinsfile for a Multibranch Pipeline project. When choosing a credential type, you want to avoid storing your password in Jenkins and introduce security risks. What can you do to pull your code from Github while still remaining secure?
Create a GitHub access token.

7. What Jenkins page allows you to add, disable, or enable plugins?
Manage Plugins

8. What allows you to test the flow of an application from start to finish to see if it is performing as designed?

13. Who can manually mark agents offline or reconnect them?
Administrators

14. Where are Jenkins directories stored?
$JENKINS_HOME

15. You are version controlling your Jenkins server configuration with Git. You set up your .gitignore file. What command can you use to start a local git repository in your current directory?
git init

16. You have a Jenkins installation with 20 agents. Every time you click on "Disconnect agent", the agent is back online within a few minutes. What is the most likely explanation for this issue?
The "Disconnect agent" option only cuts the connection to the agent and gets triggered to re-initiate the connection.

17. What must Jenkins projects contain to use "Pipeline as Code"?
A Jenkinsfile

18. When trying to create a job that is connected to source control, what is the function of a multi-configuration project?
Running the same build job on different environments

19. Why should agents be interchangeable and standardized?
To make them sharable and to optimize resource usage

20. You are viewing a pull request on a GitHub URL and trying to get tests to run on Jenkins. You determine there were no test failures on your Jenkins environment but your build is still failing. You find the following error on the console log: "The tests ran but on the wrong commit". What is the most likely explanation for this?
Your branch got rebased.
